**Disclaimer**: this is anther subject in which I have no idea.

**Disclaimer 2**: Since what I am trying to do is not a full game, but a proof of concept, I am not developing a full interface. In fact, the only interface that I am planing to develop is the in-game interface and maybe a pause menu.

I am just going to talk about the in-game 2D interface. Not menus. Not 3D things. These are the steps I have followed, probably not the best ones, but they made sense in my head.

## 1. Information of the interface

The GUI has to do mainly two things, give and get information. Now I will describe which information do the  software needs to retrieve or represent:

- **Give information to the user**:
  - Health and manna of all the entities in the game, including the own player.
  - List of actions that he can execute.
  - Places where he can execute the action and simulation of the action.
  - List of actions that he has decided to execute.
  - Time left to end the round.
- **Retrieve information from the user**:
  - Which actions the user wants to execute.
  - When is the user ready to send the action buffer.



## 2. Layout

I am not trying to be creative here. I am trying to use the experience that he has gotten in other games in my favour. In other words, I am copying the layout so it is easier for the user to understand how it works. This is what I have decided to go with:

![](/tfgblog/assets/images/Guilayout.svg){:.img}

I think that is the most conservative layout you can "create".



## 3. Design choices

I have decided to go with pixel art. Why? Mainly because is ~~easy~~ easier than other alternatives, but in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m48xthwkpI0) you can find more information about why this choice is that common in indie games.

Then I thought the right choice was to get some beautiful assets. In fact is what I did, but it turns out that since the interface is so specific at the end I needed to do all the elements by myself. That does not mean that the assets I downloaded were not useful. I have say thanks to [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) for allowing us to use his assets for free.

I also took inspiration from the interfaces of Wargrove and Into the breach and decided to show as much information as possible inside the game. By this I mean that, for example, the amount of life and manna of the entities will be shown in the map next to them, instead in one corner of the interface. The same happens with the possible moves.



## 4. Elements

Now it is time to design the different elements I will need. As a software I started used gimp.First I tried to use the same measurements that I used in the layout planning image, but they were way too big. Then I tried to make the interface smaller, but then it was too small. I will need to make a third iteration. This is the result, which I am more or less happy with, but there is still a lot of work to do:

![](/tfgblog/assets/images/elements.png){:.img}

During this procedure I discovered that this was not the best way to work, and then I saw this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwF0L55kIgg) about how Pokemon games used a grid system and just 4 colours. Now I want to use a grid system instead of just guessing numbers, this way I just need to create some basic pieces that I will copy and paste in a grid of 8x8 pixels to create all the elements of the interface and if I have to change something it will be faster. For doing this I am using [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), a open-source and general purpose tile map editor.



## Conclusion

I don't think this interface is ready for the MVP because I think there are a lots of things that will change, but in the next iteration I am sure I will have something good enough.
