## Game engine

As the game engine I have decided to use [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) since it is growing in popularity, it covers all my necessities and has some advantages over other engines:

- It is easy to work with, since it contains all the tools needed for the graphics.
- It allows python programming, so I can re-use most of the code of the server.
- It is highly configurable.
- It has a really flexible license so I do not have to worry about it regardless of the use I make.



## Objective of the graphical design

The goal with the graphics in this game is to design a pleasant graphics that allow the user to easily identify all the important elements of the game while using as less resources as possible. This means that the focus of the graphics is not to make them realistic or beautiful, but useful.



## Techniques

Right now is too soon to talk about which graphical techniques are going to be used, but some of the most interesting and that the graphical engine allows to use are:

-  [Lightmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightmap) 
- [Ambient oclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion#Implementation)
- [Low poly 3D models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_poly)
- Pre-rendered models
